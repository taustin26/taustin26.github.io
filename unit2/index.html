<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
<p>For my project, I compared the sites for <a href="http://www.hioscar.com">Oscar Insurance</a> and <a href="http://www.policygenius.com">Policy Genius</a>. These are both startups in the insurance space doing something similar to my startup.</p>
<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
<p>Oscar Insurance makes very effective use of negative space to quickly draw the readers' eyes to the introduction statement: "Hi, we're Oscar". This works well for Oscar because it is trying to be a different kind of insurance company and this immediately looks different than the typically busy insurance website. It may also help to relieve the anxiety that users are expecting when they go to an insurance site. As the ultimate goal of the company is to get visitors to sign up, the company wisely places a "Sign Up Now" button directly below the introduction, encouraging users to quickly and easily sign up for the company's service. In terms of balance, the content is heavily weighted towards the left side, leaving a large imbalance on the right side.  This seems to be effective here as the effect is pleasing (although it's not totally clear to me why that is).
<p>The landing page for Policy Genius makes heavy use of positive space, with an image of someone shopping for insurance on a computer dominating the site. The effect is that eyes are drawn to the computer image, which may be effective as the site is attempting to convince people to buy online rather than through an agent. The company also has an action oriented dropdown and button at the bottom of the page asking people to start the insurance shopping process. The site feels well balanced as the bar at the top is offset by this action area at the bottom and the computer image is balanced by the headline on the left. However, the use of loud colors and the heavy use of positive space does not result in the calming feeling achieved by Oscar.</p>
<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
<p>Oscar and PolicyGenius are similar in that they are both trying to accomplish the same thing - getting people to sign up for insurance through the website. They are also similar in that they both use continuous scrolling and often make use of negative space to draw attention to friendly images.</p> 
<p>They are different in that Oscar sticks strictly to the heavy use of negative space and cool colors while PolicyGenius often uses louder colors and has more content and positive space. Oscar also maintains the same balance between text on the left side and images on the right side throughout its page while PolicyGenius changes how content is balanced as the user scrolls through the page.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Landing Page</strong><br><img src="sketch1.jpg" alt="Landing Page"><p>For my landing page, I wanted the focal point to be the Bungalow name, with the flow then leading to the zip code entry and lastly to the "learn more" area at the bottm. I am using a lot of negative space here and weighting heavily to the left, much like Oscar does, because I think it helps draw the users eyes better than if it is centered.</p></li>
<li><strong>Education Center</strong><br><img src="sketch2.jpg" alt="Education Center"><p>For the education center, I want to continue with the heavy use of negative space and tried to balance the 3 learning options evenly across the page. I wanted to keep the zip code entry field on the page, as the user should alsways be offered this option, but wasn't quite sure where to put it. Keeping on the left seemed like it made sense at first, as it would match the balance of the landing page. But I ultimately decided to put it on the right side because it felt like a natural flow.</p></li>
<li><strong>Quote Page</strong><br><img src="sketch3.jpg" alt="Quote Page"><p>On the Quote page, I want users' eyes to immediately be drawn to the price, which is the focal point of the page. I then want to lay out the policy they will receive in a simple and calming way, and felt like the balance approach achieves that.</p></li>
<li><strong>More Info Page</strong><br><img src="sketch4.jpg" alt="More Info Page"><p>I struggled a little bit with the layout on this page. I want the price to remain in the same place as the prior page so as to limit mental strain for the user. At the same time, I feel like this upsets the pattern of left-weighted balance that I've used on the other page, as the information entry will then have to dominate the right side of the page. I think it works like this but will have to think on it further.</p></li>
